JSON exercises:Weather App

Hello! Good morning.


Congrats for the “Book Store” exercise. Nice to see how you are growing like future developers.


In this case I don't want to say you how to make nothing in the project. Let fly your imagination.


I show you a sneak peak of my possible solution. You need to make something like this, or something completely different. 
Play!!

Here is the data:

https://api.myjson.com/bins/i8run. 

And here is the snapshot of my project:

.
An onteresting approach is to use a search input to find the city that you want. But you have to “play” with the open weather API: 

https://openweathermap.org/api

.
Good luck!

openweathermap.org - 
Weather API - OpenWeatherMap
 - Simple and fast and free weather API from OpenWeatherMap you have access to current weather data, 5- and 16-day forecasts, UV Index, air pollution and historical data.
